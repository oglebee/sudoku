The sudoku_gui now goes with the sudoku_solver. Sudoku gui has one pre-loaded board to play with the 'Load' button. If you put one or more numbers and hit solve, the solver will eh, solve the board. The window elements I think only resize in one axis. We like to have fun here. My next fun thing is to flatten a sudoku board into 1d array and start graphing all sixtillion valid board with their relative distances from each other. Or maybe I just look at the distances of all the ones in the number or something. I need a job please.
