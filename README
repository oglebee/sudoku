My dad made this years ago in visual basic. With very little skills of my own I am trying to make it functional again with the help of some modern tools. Wish me luck.

I believe the three corresponding, newest files in the src folder are; 'frmSodoku V17.FRM', 'Sodoku Solver V17.vbw', Sodoku Solver V17.vbp'.
Though my dad can't remember which version the compiled .exe ever came from. 

Update: VB6 was a poor choice. Will need to do VB6->VB.NET? Daunting with 4500 lines in a .FRM.

I added some python code, mostly stolen from online. It does some basic things so far and is the color blue.
